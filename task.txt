1. Set up the latest Laravel. This should be done on a branch 'master'

2. Create a blog on its base (any blog from the internet can be used, or you can write a basic one yourself). Blog post should consist of at least 2 fields - title and body. This should be done as a separate branch 'laravel_blog'.

3. On the article edit page there should be two buttons ( this should be a separate branch 'image_buttons' with 'laravel_blog' as a base):
'search image' button, that searches random image on the internet (you can use any API you like, for example, https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images) by the title of the post, and shows one without a page reload. Each time you click it - a random picture from API should be displayed next to it.
'insert image' button inserts an image tag with an image that was 'found' by the first button at the beginning of the body of the post.


So, in the end, there should be 3 branches:

image_buttons
|
laravel_blog
|
master

Laravel tools must be used as much as possible.
Provide the result as a git repository (in github or bitbucket).
